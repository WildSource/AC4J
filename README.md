# AC4J
Auto-Clicker for Java. Is a very simple auto clicker written in java. It is very basic and is a big messy spaghetti code. Use it at your own risk I am not responsible for the dumb shit you do with it.

# How to use
You fill in the amount of delay between clicks (it is measured in milliseconds) and click on start.
To stop it you click the stop button.

# Warnings
 you probably shouldn't uncheck the always stay on top checkbox.
 There is no killswitch so you better press that stop button
